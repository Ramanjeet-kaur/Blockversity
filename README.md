Blockversity



The Objective of this project is to make user friendly Ethereum Based Marketplace which has features like:



●	The marketplace page will have the  real-time updates of Ether currency and course prices compared to the US dollar.

●	The modal window is dedicated to making orders

●	 Email hashing solution to maintain client's privacy. 

●	Order view with order filtering.

Introduction

●	Marketplace is a decentralized app that means it a digital applications that exist and run on a blockchain or P2P network of computers instead of a single computer, and are outside the purview and control of a single authority. This application will be built in the Next JS framework with Css. Next JS is internally using React library.

●	This app is made to help client to buy courses from digital currency etherium.

●	Ethereum is a technology that lets you send cryptocurrency to anyone for a small fee. It also powers applications that everyone can use and no one can take down.  It let you use digital money without payment providers or banks.

●	For buying any course clients can connect through their metamask account which is cryptocurrency wallet used to interact through Ethereum blockchain. MetaMask allows users to store and manage account keys, broadcast transactions, send and receive etherium based crypto currencies.

●	Client  will interact with a smart contract through the website connected to the blockchain network through the Metamask wallet.

●	Smart contracts use blockchain technology to verify, validate, capture and enforce agreed-upon terms between multiple parties. Smart contracts on the blockchain allow for transactions and agreements to be carried out among anonymous parties without the need for a central entity, external enforcement, or legal system.




Tech-Stack Used


It is a Web Application built using NextJS, TailwindCss And Blockchain

This website has 2 modules

•	Client Module

•	Admin Module

  

Client  Module:

●	Can view courses detail

●	Can buy various courses through ether

●	He can see the transaction

●	Can access the course after the admin will activate his course

Admin module:


●	Can activate or deactivate any course purchased by client 

•	Can check which courses have been purchased, activated or deactivated

Project Conclusion

•	The system was designed in such a way that future modifications can be done easily.

•	It provides a friendly graphical user interface which proves to be better for users.

•	The application has adequate scope for modification if it is necessary.

•	Blockversity aims at using blockchain technology to allow content creators to get paid for their efforts from their users directly. 

•	Instead of having the social network make all the money and then pass along a far smaller share to content creators, that middleman has been eliminated entirely using this project.

•	But even more than that, blockchain is being used for trying to give content creators better control over how their content is shared, distributed and even consumed by their target audiences
